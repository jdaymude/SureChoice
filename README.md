# SureChoice

Understanding health insurance plans can be difficult, and comparing the pros and cons of different plans can be especially complex. This Python script plots your out-of-pocket cost for different plans as a function of total annual incurred medical costs so you can make better-informed decisions about your health insurance plan.

Some plans may be quite cost-effective if your total medical costs are low, but will be extremely costly if an expensive medical event happens unexpectedly. Some scale more linearly. Others cost a lot out-of-pocket up front, but pay off with higher total medical costs. Comparing plans in this way enables you to choose the best plan for your expected medical costs.


## Background and Key Terms

When using this code, it helps to understand a few key health insurance terms:

- _premium_: a fixed monthly payment for being on a plan.
- _deductible_: the total out-of-pocket amount to be paid before insurance covers anything.
- _copay_: the percentage of a total cost to be paid out-of-pocket after the deductible is met.
- _maximum out-of-pocket_: the maximum total out-of-pocket cost before insurance covers 100% of all subsequent payments.
